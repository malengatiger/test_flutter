# Busha Demo App for Assessment

## Description

This repository contains a **Flutter** application that implements the requirements as indicated for assessment. The app supports both **Android** and **iOS** devices. It can be dynamically set to dark or light mode. The user can also dynamically set the primary color that the app uses.

The app accesses the various endpoints referenced through a connection to a **GCP** hosted **NodeJS** backend application built with **NestJS**. Authentication is provided via **Firebase**. 

The backend code lives at https://github.com/malengatiger/test_backend

## Features implemented:

* Landing Page
* User SignIn / Registration
* Latest Block

[//]: # (* Tezos Block)
[//]: # (* Block Transactions)
* Trending News
* My Assets
* Settings

On first installation of the app the user has to register first. The email requested does not have to be a real email address. The address is merely used to authenticate the user and has no other purpose. If already registered the user can sign in instead.
